As of Version 0.6 this program is a generic Java heuristic Path Algorithm.  What this means is, if one variable is edited
it can become A*, uniform cost, or pure heuristic search.  (This value is w, or in my program walk constant.)  VETwo is
main.  If you run that the program will run the search on the 8 tile puzzle which I have already programmed.  This is all
in the package hPath. Outside of hPath I have started work on some graph programs, they aren't  implemented yet.  The are
meant to test A*'s g values.
