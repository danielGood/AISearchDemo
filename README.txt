in the path to make the generic hpath i face problems on several fronts

reflection constructors
	*shouldn't have to be done through arrays
	*currently I am putting parameters in - but can't have that
	*type conversion?
	*otherwise it seems to work

equals works

clone dosn't seem to work
	*or when it does I can't access it 
	*how i can access it is by making it public and accessing it through reflection
	*this seems like a work a round
